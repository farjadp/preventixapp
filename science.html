                <p>Preventix is built on evidence-based dental prevention principles and designed with clinical oversight.</p>

                    <h2>Evidence-Based Approach</h2>
                    <p>Dental health is strongly influenced by dietary patterns. Frequent exposure to sugars and acids increases the risk of decay and enamel erosion.</p>
                    <p>Preventix addresses this through environmental design rather than individual education. The goal is to reduce exposure at a structural level.</p>

                    <div class="mt-3">
                        <h2>Clinical Oversight</h2>
                        <p>Our approach is developed with input from dental health professionals. We focus on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reducing sugar and acid exposure</li>
                            <li>Creating tooth-safe food environments</li>
                            <li>Supporting long-term risk reduction</li>
                            <li>Measuring real-world outcomes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="mt-3">
                        <h2>Focus on Long-Term Risk Reduction</h2>
                        <p>Prevention is not immediate. It happens over time through consistent environmental conditions.</p>
                        <p>Preventix creates those conditions at scale. The result is measurable risk reduction across populations, not short-term behavior change in individuals.</p>

                    <div class="mt-3">
                        <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
                        <p>Preventix does not make medical claims. We do not guarantee health outcomes for individuals. We do not diagnose or treat dental conditions.</p>
                        <p>We create environments that reduce risk factors. Organizations and populations benefit from those environments over time.</p>

                        <p>We're building outcome data through pilot programs. If your organization is interested in evidence-based prevention, let's talk.</p>
